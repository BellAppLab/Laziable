//MARK: - Main
/**
 The main point of interaction with `Laziable`.

 You create a `Lazy` object by:

 ```swift
 let lazyThing = §{
     return <#code#>
 }
 ```

 At this point, `Lazy` is just storing the `Constructor` closure passed to it, not the underlying `Value`.
 Upon calling `lazyThing§`, `Lazy` will evaluate if a `Value` already exists. If it does, it will return it.
 If it doesn't, it will create a new one using the `Constructor`.

 By calling `lazyThing §= nil` you can then release the underlying `Value` and free some memory.
