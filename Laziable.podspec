So you declared a `lazy var` in Swift thinking it would behave like lazily instantiated variables in good ol' Objective-C. You thought you would set them to `nil` and they would reconstruct themselves later on when needed.

You poor thing.

[They don't](https://stackoverflow.com/a/40847994).

So why not bring that awesomeness back to Swift in a very lightweight way?
